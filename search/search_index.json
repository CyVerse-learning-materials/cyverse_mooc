However, several analyses we'd like to do are interactive -- we need to visualize and manipulate parameters on the fly -- for example, creating a figure where you need to see and adjust the results of an upstream analysis. </p> <p>This kind of work is often done using tools like R and RStudio, or other programing tools such as Jupyter.
